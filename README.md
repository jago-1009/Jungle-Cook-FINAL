- ### Create recipes
- ### View the recipe Instructions
- ### Edit the recipes as needed
- ### Delete recipes
## It also allows for account storage through Google Firebase and is fully responsive for both desktops and tablets.
## Users can sign in using the Login Page, and from there, be able to view the recipes they created, and make edits to them.
## Users will also not be able to see their recipes before signing in. Users can still browse the already made recipes, however.
